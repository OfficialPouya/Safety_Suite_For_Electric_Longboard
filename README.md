# Saftey Suite For Electric Longboard
This is my Senior Design (ECE 445) Project

The goal of the project is to increase saftey for electric longboard users. To find out more about the project, feel free to watch the presentation, demos, and the rest of this repository. This project would not have been possible without the help of Alex and Patrick.
